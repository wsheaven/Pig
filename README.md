# Overview

This is a mobile version of the dice game Pig. The rules for the game are that each player takes turns rolling the dice. Each roll is added to a current total. If the
the player rolls a 1 then the current total is earased and it is the next players turn. If the player choses to end their turn then their current total will be added 
to their overall total. The first player to 100 wins. In my version of the game you also need to declare Pig! by pressing the Pig! button. 

I created this application with the goal of becoming more familiar with android development. I decided on Pig becuase it is a personal favorite of mine.
